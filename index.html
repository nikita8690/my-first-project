      ❤Some Information About Lilac-breasted_Roller:-
    </h2>
    <p class="hi">
      ✒ The lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus) is an African bird of the
      roller family, Coraciidae. It is widely distributed in Southern and
      Eastern Africa, and is a vagrant to the southern Arabian Peninsula.[1] It
      prefers open woodland and savanna, and it is for the most part absent from
      treeless places. Usually found alone or in pairs, it perches at the tops
      of trees, poles or other high vantage points from where it can spot
      insects, amphibians and small birds moving about on the ground.[2] Nesting
      takes place in a natural hole in a tree where a clutch of 2–4 eggs are
      laid, and incubated by both parents, who are extremely aggressive in
      defence of their nest, taking on raptors and other birds. During the
      breeding season the male will rise to a fair height (69 to 144 metres),
      descending in swoops and dives,[3] while uttering harsh, discordant cries.
      The sexes do not differ in coloration, and juveniles lack the long tail
      streamers of adults. This species is unofficially considered the national
      bird of Kenya. Alternative names for the lilac-breasted roller include the
      fork-tailed roller, lilac-throated roller (also used for a subspecies of
      purple roller) and Mosilikatze's roller.

      ❤Fun Facts About Lilac-breasted_Roller:-
    </h1>
    <h3 style="color: teal">
      1. LILAC-BREASTED ROLLERS ARE NATIVE TO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA❤
    </h3>
    <p style="display: inline" ; class="hi">
      ✒ You won’t see a Lilac-breasted roller in
    </p>
    <p style="display: inline; background-color: skyblue" ; class="hi">
      North America
    </p>
    . Their range is limited to the continent of Africa. They are year-round
    residents of open woodlands south of the Saharan Desert. While they don’t
    migrate, they generally move around in their range according to the rainy
    and dry seasons.
    <h3 style="color: teal">
      2. MALES’ AND FEMALES’ FEATHERS ARE SIMILAR COLORS❤
    </h3>
    <p class="hi">
      ✒ The only way to tell males and females apart is via size. Males are a
      bit larger than females. Otherwise, both sexes look exactly the same. They
      have a bright purple throat, olive crown, and turquoise abdomen. Their
      wings can be olive tinged with brown. They have tail streamers that fly
      behind them when they soar through the air.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: teal">3. THEY CAN LIVE UP TO 10 YEARS OLD❤</h3>
    <p class="hi">
      ✒ In the wild, Lilac-breasted rollers live around ten years. Animals which
      pose a threat to them include hawks and falcons. One such falcon is the
      peregrine falcon. In situations where they are kept captive and away from
      threats, they can live for several more years.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: teal">4. THEY ARE AMBUSH PREDATORS❤</h3>
    <p class="hi">
      ✒ Many carnivorous birds perch where they have a vantage point to watch
      for prey. The Lilac-breasted roller is no different.They perch on a fence
      post, tree branch, or the top of a snag and looks out over their
      territory. When they see an exposed grasshopper or beetle, they dive down
      and snag it with their beak. If the prey is large enough to fight back,
      some birds beat their quarry against the ground to kill it before they
      swallow it whole.

      5. THEY GET THEIR NAME FROM THEIR PURPLE FEATHERS AND AERIAL ACROBATICS❤
    </h3>
    <p class="hi">
      ✒ The name of this bird has two parts. First, “lilac-breasted” refers to
      their bright purple breast. Second, the word ‘roller’ is a reference to
      the way these birds fly. They fold in their wings when they dive, rolling
      through the air like vibrant torpedoes.

      6. LILAC-BREASTED ROLLERS ARE EXTREMELY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR YOUNG❤
    </h3>
    <p class="hi">
      ✒ Lilac-breasted rollers are some of the most territorial medium-sized
      birds in the African Savanna. They take on predators much larger than they
      are. These include hawks and falcons, which usually want to snag
      chicks.Mated pairs work together to patrol their territory and fight off
      any intruders, whether they be other lilac-breasted rollers or hungry
      predators.
